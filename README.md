# what im pleased with

the main thing im pleased with is getting the functions to run, i kept finding that either a semi colon or
a closing bracket was missing and the game wouldnt run.

# cons

i felt as if i could have done better with the timing if i had a better plan, as i thought i did but then iterated it during the way,
i also would've liked the scores to work earlier as i had problems with it.
